    <p>Hi there! My name is Jessica Villar; I am a restless curious mind. </p>
    <p> I am a venezuelan-spanish and in the 2019 I moved to France!</p>
    <p> My carreer started working in communications (journalism, marketing, community manager...), but when I changed country I also decided to change
        professional path and become a programmer. I already got my certificate on web
        developper and I am
        looking for a
        job in Lyon, Villeurbanne or in remote.</p>
